# What is Global Hack Week?

### What happens during Global Hack Week?

In Global Hack Week, all of the participants, form guilds (refer to the next section to learn more), complete fun and easy challenges every day, earning points for themselves and the guild. The challenges can be done like mini-hackathon projects, and you can also form teams with friends for the challenges. You can do the challenges individually as well, but teams are recommended! You can always find teammates in your guild's private discord channel or you could team up with cross-guild members through MLH's public channel (#looking-for-team)

### What are Global Hack Week Guilds?

Guilds are a community or clan, The guild is a really big team, every point you earn goes to you and your guild, and the friendly competition is to try and get your guild at the top. But that's just not it, the guild leaders, work hard to provide their guild with the tools and resources, I led a guild previously and we even posted ideas for every challenge, to our members, to make it easier! We also got teams made within our guild. But the bigger picture is, that the guild is a community, a community of people willing to help you excel in your hackathon journey.
