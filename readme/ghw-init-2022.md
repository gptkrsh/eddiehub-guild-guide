### Tips

* Make a team! Teams are the best thing you can have in a week-long event, with nothing to worry about. It's a chill hackathon after-all, do as many challenges as you wish, and leave the rest :relaxed:
  * "Collaboration First, Code Second" -- Eddie Jaoude
  * "I don't think you should worry about skill level, the idea would be to get a team that complements each other so not everyone needs to be able to do frontend or backend or database etc." -- Emma Dawson
* Don't burn out, only spend as much time as you'd like to, as I've mentioned "It's a chill hackathon, after all, do as many challenges as you wish, and leave the rest :relaxed:"
  * "Itâ€™s not really a classic hackathon but more a series of workshops and events throughout the week where you can learn different things. Last time they had things like create a discord bot, learn some web 3, mobile development etc." -- Emma Dawson
* Join one hangout event at least one! It is really fun and motivating - there was a time when the only event I used to join was Chrome Dino ðŸ˜œ
* There are a lot of workshops - you don't need to join all - check the schedule and handpick the ones you'd like too :)
